# hapi-fhir-3to4-demo
Using a modified version of the package [hl7.fhir.xver.r4#1.2.0](http://fhir.org/packages/hl7.fhir.xver.r4/), where the target URL's are versioned to 4.0, this repo contains a set of STU3 FHIR resource examples that are transformed using the HAPI validator_cli.  

A python script is used along with github actions to run the transforms.  The modified package must be loaded into your local package cache for this to work if doing it locally.  See the ./github/workflow yml for an example of how to do it on Linux, or refer to the HL7 guidance on [NPM packaging](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification) for further details on FHIR packages.    

The set of STU3 examples used are copied from https://github.com/rbren/fhir-swagger/tree/master/schemas/dstu3/examples.  Only 794 out of 2,496 (as of 14/01/22) are being used here as the validator_cli does not currently appear to support more complex resources like bundles and resources with contained resources.  The "id" element has also been removed from all resources as this is not currently handled by the validator_cli.jar.  However, for migration purposes having the "id" transfer over to the new resource is probably not a desirable outcome anyway.
